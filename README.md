# git-open
Simple bash script to open a github repo

## Installation

Nice and simple, just need to ensure the script is in your `$PATH`.

Download the repo and run `make` to install it in `/usr/local/bin`. Note if
you're running Linux you might need to prefix with `sudo` to allow `cp` to
create a file there.
